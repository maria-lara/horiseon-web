# Notes
Per the client's request, the Title should be concise and descriptive. "Horiseon Markeing Agency" is both consice and describes who the agency is, "Horiseon," and what is it, "Agency," and what it does, "Marketing." However, a personal preference would have included keywords to go beyond simply describing the agency for the purpose of grabbing a user's attention more. For example, "Best Marketing Agency in Sacramento | Horiseon." This would also help the agency's SEO by including keywords that are often searched for when finding a potential vendor (as commonly seen on Yelp Reviews).
