## Motivation
Since Horiseon provides SEO services for their clients, it is essential that they are able to uphold these services for their own company's reputation. By enhancing their own website's SEO, they are able to provide an example for potential clients, as well as make their services more widespread on the internet. Although the true key to "winning" SEO is unknown, there are a few factors that are known to contribute to SEO ranking/

One of these methods is through accessibility. Accessibility refers to a website's ability to adhere to the latest WCAG standards. This allows screen-readers to accurately describe website to those with vision impairments or disabilities. With HTML5 and WCAG 2.0 updates, there are now more ways than ever to increase SEO. The Structure below will refer to methods used.

## Structure
* **Title:** The Title is a powerful element, as it is one of the largest contributors to SEO-accessibility. Titles are displayed on search engines and therefore will be identified first. It is important to ensure that the Title includes the name of the website/company, its services, and related keywords. 

*Per the client's request, the Title should be concise and descriptive. "Horiseon Markeing Agency" is both consice and describes who the agency is, "Horiseon," and what is it, "Agency," and what it does, "Marketing." However, a personal preference would have included keywords to go beyond simply describing the agency for the purpose of grabbing a user's attention more. For example, "Best Marketing Agency in Sacramento | Horiseon." This would also help the agency's SEO by including keywords that are often searched for when finding a potential vendor (as commonly seen on Yelp Reviews).*

* **Header,Footer:** The Header/Footer comes next, as it often contains multiple aspects of a website: logo, navigation, address, and phone number.

* **Nav:** Nav refers to the navigation section of the website. This is the second most important element for HTML5, because it often offers links or anchors to other pages relevant to the website. Navigation terms are often written as the keywords most associated with the company's services, and therefore often searched by the public when in need of those services.

* **Articles, Sections, Aside:** These three elements are a way to segment bigger pieces of content that portray an idea in a different manner. For example, a Section can contain a list of services provided by a company. This is important because the public will often search for the service they need directly. However, the public may not know that service by name and type in a question or problem instead. The website can then attract these users by using Aside to provide language that is related to that question. On top of this, Articles may contain keywords related to the area they serve, key members of the public, and referrals. All three allow multiple avenues to get to the same website for the same services.

* **Audio, Video, Figure:** Adding "rich content," which is content that goes beyond text, is a great way to capture the attention of search engines like Google. Within these types of content may be alternative text (keywords describing the images) or related content.
